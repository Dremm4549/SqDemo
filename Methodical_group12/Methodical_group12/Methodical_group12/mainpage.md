A TMS is a critical part of the shipping and logistics industry. Allowing for the purchasing, scheduling, monitoring and billing of organizations who desire to have cargo shipped via truck or train, the TMS system you will be working on this semester is a representation of a system that has been worked on by SET students in their co-op work terms.

This application will keep track of orders that customs send to Omnicorp Corporation.

The Planner employee is responsible for furthering the order by selecting one or more registered Carriers to fulfill the Order, in the form of Trips. Once assigned, the Planner monitors the progression of time in the application, ensuring that when all Trips on an order are completed, the Order will be marked as Completed and sent back to the Buyer for Invoice Generation. Finally, the Planner may also produce reports showing aggregate activity in OSHT.

The buyer represents an employee of OSHT who is tasked with requesting Customer contracts from the Contract Marketplace and generating an initial Order or contract. Their chief output is an Order, which is marked for action by the Planner. After the Plannerâ€™s work is completed, the Buyer confirms each completed Order and generates an Invoice to the Customer.

The Admin user role represents an individual at OSHT who has IT experience and is tasked with configuration, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the TMS application.
